### Easy crack me


### Description

This project is very simple, just a binary that will ask an user and a serial number
your objective is try bypass this using reverse engineer in assembly

may I'll put other levels inside this project, the idea is make more crackmes to arm64

## Requirements

OS: MacOs 10^
Architecture: ARM64

## How start

There's 2 files in this project.
An `main.s` that is an assembly file, you should link they using a command 
`clang main.s -o main`

The `.c` source code's `.zip` file inside the "source" folder

## Note 
The zip's password is "f0f0ca", you should unzip that is you want see the code
please, the idea here is that you really try crack that, think 2 times before just see the code  


good luck, any ask about the project, please open a issue
